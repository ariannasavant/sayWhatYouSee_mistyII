# sayWhatYouSee_mistyII
This repo provides the Misty II robot with a new skill: she can say what she sees! Misty will listen for the "Hey Misty" keyword, then photograph whatever is in her direct line of vision. She will upload the image, and then speak back an MP3 audio file, describing the image.
